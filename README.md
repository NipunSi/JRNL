### JRNL

JRNL is a minimalist daily journaling app. It allows users to write entries using given prompts and attach a mood to each entry. Users can also look back on and search through previous journal entries.

### How it works

The app uses Realm for data storage and persistence. Each entry in the database is given a timestamp, prompt, mood, and content. From there the entries can be sorted, queried, and edited.
